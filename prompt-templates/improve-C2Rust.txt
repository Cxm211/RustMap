You will be provided the Rust code generated by C2Rust from C source code. Follow the instructions below to improve the given Rust code and the goal is to enhance readability, safety, and performance while ensuring compliance with Rust idioms and best practices. Generate the complete improved code. 

1. Memory Management: Replace malloc/free with Rust's Vec, Box, or smart pointers. Minimize unsafe usage.
2. Pointer Handling: Convert raw pointers to references (&T, &mut T) where possible, and properly manage lifetimes.
3. Safety: Remove undefined behavior by replacing risky pointer arithmetic and adding bounds checks. Replace C-style error codes with Result/Option.
4. Global State: Replace mutable globals with Mutex/RwLock to ensure thread safety.
5. Control Flow: Replace goto with proper error handling (Result or break). Convert switch/case to match.
6. C Macros: Convert to constants or inline functions in Rust. Use cfg for conditional compilation.
7. Type and Data Handling: Replace C arrays with slices (&[T]) or vectors (Vec<T>). Use Rust enums for integer constants.
8. Idiomatic Rust: Use iterators, match, borrowing, and pattern matching to make code more concise and idiomatic.
